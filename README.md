Composite data masking utility.

## Goal
Implement instruments, describe practices, contracts to solve sensitive data masking problem in JS/TS.
For logs, for public data output and so on.

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ / Experimental / Early preview

### Roadmap
- [ ] Introduce (declarative?) masking directives  
- [ ] Describe masking strategies and add masking utils  
- [ ] Implement masking composer/processor  
- [ ] Support logging tools integration  

## Motivation
Enterprise development has specific requirements for the masking tools.
And it seems that open source solutions do not fully satisfy them. 
Detailed thoughts on this subject are presented in the article "In search of JS data masker".
